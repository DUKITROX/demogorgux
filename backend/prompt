My goal is to build an AI agent which automizes demos. I want it so that the agent is able to join a call and simulate "sharing its screen" and he is able to show how to interact with a given website and demo it. So the agent has to be able to understand the given website well enough in order to be able to demo it and answer the users questions. Also, I was thinking of leveraging Claude tool for searching website which I belive you can also see how the tool is moving the mouse, typing over stuff.... For now, lets just focus on demoing https://app.paid.ai/. If you any questions about how to proceed go ahead and ask me. Also, think it through, I want something which works well and understand the website quite well
