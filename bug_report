- Change agent name from Alex to DemoX, and instead of him waiting at the beginning for your first prompt, I want him to feel more like an assistant in the sense that he proactivly tries to explain you stuff. Also when I talk with him, it feels like he is discovering/learning the website along with you. I dont want that, I want him to have the personality of already the stuff and hes just explaining it to you.
- remove the "Looks like you might be away — just ping me when you're ready to continue!" message which appears every 15-20 seconds
